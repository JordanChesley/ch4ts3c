**Ch4ts3c** is a Next.JS + Socket.io chatroom you can spin up for you and your friends to talk! Surely there's no vulnerabilities, right?

Good luck and enjoy exploiting this simple web service.

## About the .env file...

This project was initially intended to be a quick demo app for people to downloaded, so I didn't mind posting the secrets for everyone to copy. Obviously this solution is flawed and I will be working a new centralized authentication server that this project can call to.

## Installation

If you'd like to download and run this app yourself, you may use the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` to build and run the image.
